# NeuralNet

NeuralNet aims to allow for building complex neural networks by specifying RNN (recurrent neural network) architectures. Once architectures are specified, the networks can be trained using BPTT (back-propagation through time) given training data, or using GA (gradient approximation) given a training function (like a fitness function or error function).

## Installation

**TODO: Add repo to hex to allow for public use and installation

The package can be installed as:

  Add neural_nets to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

        def deps do
          [{:neural_net, "~> 0.0.1"}]
        end
